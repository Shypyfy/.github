# Blockchain Supply Chain Application

## Overview

This project implements a **blockchain-based supply chain management system** designed to improve transparency, traceability, and security across the supply chain.

The system leverages blockchain technology to:

- Track the movement of goods securely and immutably.
- Detect and prevent fraud in the supply chain.
- Provide real-time visibility to all stakeholders.
- Automate processes using smart contracts.

## Features

- Decentralized ledger for immutable tracking of supply chain events.
- Smart contracts for automated verification and enforcement.
- User roles: suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers.
- Tamper-proof audit trails for products.
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time data capture (optional).

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Platform:** [Ethereum / Hyperledger / Your choice]
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (or your smart contract language)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Go / Python (specify your choice)
- **Frontend:** React / Angular / Vue (optional)
- **Database:** IPFS, or traditional database for off-chain data
- **Other Tools:** Truffle, Hardhat, Ganache (for Ethereum development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Blockchain development environment (Ganache, Hardhat, etc.)
- Solidity compiler (if using Ethereum)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure your blockchain network settings in the config file.

4. Deploy smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   # or
   yarn deploy
   ```

5. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. (Optional) Start the frontend app:

   ```bash
   npm run frontend
   ```

## Usage

Describe how users interact with your supply chain system, e.g.,

- Registering new products.
- Recording shipping events.
- Querying product provenance.
- Validating authenticity.
